# Panama_Proyecto_final
A comparison of the functional richness between 3 bird families found in both tropical and temperate environments. Families include: Trochilidae (Humingbirds), Tyrannidae (Tyrant-flycatchers), and Accipitridae (Hawks, Eagles).

To do:
Find the data for the three families on BirdLife.org, individually for Panama and North America
Aggregate a dataset for region
Add a column that indicates the region
Join all the data together into one dataframe

get data

07/31-08/01 manipulate data
  
  put data into mfd
  get functional richness for each species

08/02 boxplot and scatter plot 
analysis of visualization and a conclusion
why do we see this ditribution, what influences spcies richness in the tropics

08/03 ask cristina if it needs to be recorded,
time to make slides and record if yes
